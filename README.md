# Chinese ASTE Dataset
Our dataset serves as an accessible resource for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) on Chinese restaurant reviews from Google Maps.

For further information, please refer to our publication:  
[Automatic Construction of a Chinese Review Dataset for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction via Iterative Weak Supervision](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.167/)


## File Structure
- `data/raw/raw.csv`: It consists of 104358 raw restaurant reviews collected from Google Maps.
- `data/train/train.json`, `valid/valid.json`, `test/test.json`: These files respectively contain 64007, 5000, and 5000 restaurant reviews, along with the corresponding processed labels generated by our models.
- `data/test/test_gold300.json`: This file includes a subset of the testing set, consisting of 300 reviews with manually annotated ground truth.
- `src/mt5_aste.py`: python codes of ASTE model.

    abstract = "Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE), introduced in 2020, is a task that involves the extraction of three key elements: target aspects, descriptive opinion spans, and their corresponding sentiment polarity. This process, however, faces a significant hurdle, particularly when applied to Chinese languages, due to the lack of sufficient datasets for model training, largely attributable to the arduous manual labeling process. To address this issue, we present an innovative framework that facilitates the automatic construction of ASTE via Iterative Weak Supervision, negating the need for manual labeling, aided by a discriminator to weed out subpar samples. The objective is to successively improve the quality of this raw data and generate supplementary data. The effectiveness of our approach is underscored by our results, which include the creation of a substantial Chinese review dataset. This dataset encompasses over 60,000 Google restaurant reviews in Chinese and features more than 200,000 extracted triplets. Moreover, we have also established a robust baseline model by leveraging a novel method of weak supervision. Both our dataset and model are openly accessible to the public.",
