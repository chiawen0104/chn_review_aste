# Chinese ASTE Dataset
Our dataset serves as an accessible resource for conducting Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) on Chinese restaurant reviews from Google Maps.

For further information, please refer to our publication, "Automatic Construction of a Chinese Review Dataset for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction via Iterative Weak Supervision" in LREC-COLING 2024.


## File Structure
- `data/raw/raw.csv`: It consists of 104358 raw restaurant reviews collected from Google Maps.
- `data/train/train.json`, `valid/valid.json`, `test/test.json`: These files respectively contain 64007, 5000, and 5000 restaurant reviews, along with the corresponding processed labels generated by our models.
- `data/test/test_gold300.json`: This file includes a subset of the testing set, consisting of 300 reviews with manually annotated ground truth.
- `src/mt5_aste.py`: python codes of ASTE model.

## Model Usage
Use our dataset to conduct Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE). Note that please train the model before inference and chcck your directory path.
1. Create conda environment:
`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`

2. Download the pretrained model from huggingface (https://huggingface.co/chiawen0104/mt5-drcd-qa):
  ```bash
  pip3 install huggingface-hub
  ```
  ```python
  from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
  model_id = "chiawen0104/mt5-drcd-qa" # hugginFace's model name
  snapshot_download(
    repo_id=model_id,
    local_dir=<your_dir_name>,
    local_dir_use_symlinks=False,
    revision="main"
  )
  ```

3. Train the mT5 ASTE model:
`bash train.sh`

4. Inference:
`bash inference.sh`
